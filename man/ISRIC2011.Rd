\description{
Generalised GIS map of 16 main phosphorus retention potential classes
at 5 arc-minute resolution.
}
\details{
Acidity (pH), soil mineralogy, and clay content were used to rate
the inferred capacity for P retention using four classes (Low, Moderate,
High, and Very High) for each FAO soil unit combining them into 16 different
possible classes per map unit.

Each map unit of 5 by 5 arc-minutes consists of up to eight different soil
units. The overall soil phosphorus retention potential was assessed for each 
mapping unit, taking into account the P ratings and relative proportion of 
each component FAO soil unit. A hierarchical clustering of the combined soil 
unit ratings resulted in 16 main P retention classes (MainCLASS) subidivided 
into 166 2nd level classes (FullClass), and 280 3rd level classes. Only the
most  extensive and most limiting  P retention class (MainCLASS)  has been
shown in the generalised GIS map.  Classes like 'VH3'', Hi3', 'Mo3' and Lo3'
are typically comprised of a combination of several 2nd level P retention
classes, albeit in widely varying proportions.

Although uncertainties remain high, the analysis provides an
approximation of world soil phosphorus retention potential.

Values assigned assuming that the following is an ascending order
of soil phosphorus retention classes:
